    <h1>Boo, your new book companion</h1>
    <p>Project done for the Web Technologies course, FII, Year 2</p>
    <p>By Lau Mihaela Daiana and Blindu Andrada Mihaela</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>Purpose and Product Scope</h3>
    <p>
        The purpose of the app is to act like a user-friendly book annotation app and an online library. With user
        groups, friends, and a visual news section. The user can see when someone leaves a comment on a book, or wants
        to read something, etc. The inspiration of this app is the well known "Good reads".
    </p>
    <h3>Document Conventions</h3>
    <p>
        Within the whole web application, we only used a color palette of 5 colors (#3d284f, #57356A, #714E7D, #B790C2,
        #E3CEDD) and white (#fff). For fonts, we used -Nunito Sans.
    </p>
    <h3>Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h3>
    <p>
        Our app only has two types of users intended, and that is the reader and the admin. The reader can join groups,
        make friends, add books to their library, leave comments and ratings, and search for new books.
    </p>
    <h3>Reference</h3>
    <p>Our main reference is Good reads, a well-known book annotating app</p>
    <h2>Overall Description</h2>
    <p>
        BOO is a new stand-alone app meant to act as a companion for the reader, as well as allow people to create a
        community of readers who love the same books.
    </p>
    <h3>Product Functions</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>The App contains the following functions</p>
        <li>Register/LogIn/LogOut/Change Account settings</li>
        <li>Join Groups</li>
        <li>Search Books/Filter Search by genre</li>
        <li>Leave comments/Ratings</li>
        <li>Check the RSS feed</li>
        <li>Export statistics</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Operating Environment</h3>
    <p>
        Our intention is to make the web application easy to use on any device, with it being platform independent, we
        want it to be responsive.
    </p>
    <h3>User Documentation</h3>
    <p>
        The user can find the page "About" on the header of the application. Within it, they can find a link to a "Help"
        Section meant to help them learn how to use the application.
    </p>
    <h3>Dependencies</h3>
    <p>None</p>
    <h2>System Features</h2>
    <h3>See book</h3>
    <p>
        The user can click on any book and see its description, genres alongside all the comments that have been left
        and its ratings.
    </p>
    <p>Backend: When a user clicks on a book, a PHP script queries the database to fetch the book's details including its
        description, genres, comments, and ratings. This data is then sent back to the frontend using AJAX and displayed to the user.</p>
    <h3>Join Groups</h3>
    <p>
        Within the app, the user can see the available groups alongside a description of it and can join it if they wish
        to. Once in a group, they can see the members that are also part of it and their latest comments.
    </p>
    <p>Backend: When a user decides to join a group, a PHP script adds an entry into the user-group relationship table in the
        database. The list of members and their comments are fetched from the database using AJAX and displayed on the group page.</p>
    <h3>Create Groups</h3>
    <p>
        The user is also capable of creating groups on their own. They automatically are part of it.
    </p>
    <p>Backend: When a new group is created, the PHP script inserts the new group details into the groups table in the
        database and adds the creator to the user-group relationship table as a member of that group. The frontend is updated using AJAX.</p>
    <h3>See your account</h3>
    <p>
        The user has the ability to see their own account and change the information shown on it. They can see: since
        when the account has been created, the name, a button for settings, the current books they are reading, what
        groups they are part of, and other information.
    </p>
    <p>Backend: The account details are fetched from the database using a PHP script that queries the user table based on the
        session user ID. The information is then displayed on the account page using AJAX for dynamic updates.</p>
    <h3>See others account</h3>
    <p>
        The user can see other people's accounts, from their groups or from the main page. They can see: since when the
        account has been created, the name, the current books they are reading, what groups they are part of, and other
        information.
    </p>
    <p>Backend: Similar to viewing one's own account, the details of other users are fetched from the database using a PHP
        script that queries the user table based on the selected user ID. This information is then displayed on the account
        page using AJAX.</p>
    <h3>Change account information</h3>
    <p>
        The settings make it possible to change the profile photo, the description, the name, and the about me section.
    </p>
    <p>Backend: When account information is updated, the PHP script updates the respective fields in the user table in the
        database. This ensures that the latest information is stored and displayed using AJAX for smooth user experience.</p>
    <h3>Search Books</h3>
    <p>
        The user can search for certain books and choose the genre too. If they click the search button, all books in
        the database will appear. If they then want a certain genre, they can choose from the one that can be found in
        the database, which are dynamically shown.
    </p>
    <p>Backend: The search functionality is powered by a PHP script that queries the book table in the database based on the
        search input and selected genres. The results are then returned to the frontend and displayed to the user using AJAX.</p>
    <h3>Add to Shelves</h3>
    <p>
        The user can add any book to their library. It can be to read, reading, or read. This can be changed around as
        many times as they want.
    </p>
    <p>Backend: Adding a book to a shelf involves inserting or updating an entry in the user-library relationship table in
        the database. This action is performed by a PHP script based on the user's input and the frontend is updated using AJAX.</p>
    <h3>Leave annotations on books</h3>
    <p>
            </p>
    <p>Backend: Comments are added to the book by inserting a new entry into the comments table in the database. A PHP
        script handles this operation and ensures the comment is linked to the correct book and user.</p>
    <h3>Leave ratings</h3>
    <p>
        The user can leave one rating per book which will change the overall ratings.
    </p>
    <p>Backend: Ratings are added or updated in the ratings table in the database by a PHP script. This script also recalculates
        the overall rating for the book and updates it accordingly. AJAX is used to dynamically update the displayed rating.</p>
    <h3>Export statistics</h3>
    <p>
        The user can export the statistics of the top 5 books ordered by ratings in minimal form, CSV, or DocBook. The
        CSV is downloadable.
    </p>
    <p>Backend: The export functionality is managed by a PHP script that queries the database for the top 5 books by ratings.
        It then formats the data into the chosen format (CSV or DocBook) and makes it available for download. AJAX is used to handle the export requests.</p>
    <h3>Check RSS feed</h3>
    <p>
        The user can check the RSS feed which shows the latest 10 books added and the latest 10 comments that have been
        posted on the app. To ensure they can visualize the RSS feed as best as possible no matter on the web browser
        they use, the RSS file is flattened into an HTML file when checked in case the web browser cannot read the XML.
    </p>
    <p>Backend: The RSS feed is generated by querying the database for the latest 10 books and comments. A PHP script creates
        the RSS feed in XML format and then flattens it into an HTML file for compatibility. AJAX is used to fetch and display the feed.</p>
    <h2>System Users</h2>
    <p>
        The app currently only has two types of users, the standard user and the admin. The admin has the same
        capabilities as the normal user, with a few additional functionalities:
    </p>
    <h3>Admin</h3>
    <p>
        The admin is the only one who can add books, delete users, delete books, delete groups, and see a separate
        account which has the power to work with the database without having to check it from phpMyAdmin.
    </p>
    <h3>Add Books</h3>
    <p>
        The admin can add books, by giving the needed information. For photos, URLs are used. For genres, the admin can
        add as many as they want, using commas to differentiate them. In case one of the genres they added isn't in the
        database, a new entry will be created for it.
    </p>
    <p>Backend: Adding a book involves inserting a new entry into the book table in the database. The genres are parsed and
        checked against the genres table. If a genre does not exist, a new entry is created. This is handled by a PHP script.</p>
    <h3>Delete users</h3>
    <p>
        The admin can delete users in case there are instances of users being mean, or for bots to be created and used
        to spam comments/rate.
    </p>
    <p>Backend: Deleting a user is managed by a PHP script that removes the user entry from the user table and ensures that all
        related data (like comments and ratings) are also handled appropriately.</p>
    <h3>Delete Books</h3>
    <p>
        In case the information of a book is wrong, or it wasn't supposed to be posted, the admin can delete it. All
        comments are deleted, ratings aren't.
    </p>
    <p>Backend: A PHP script handles the deletion of a book, removing its entry from the book table and deleting associated
        comments. Ratings are retained but are flagged as orphaned until reassigned or managed.</p>
    <h3>Delete Groups</h3>
    <p>In case a group is used for spam, the admin can delete it.</p>
    <p>Backend: Deleting a group involves removing the group's entry from the groups table and managing the user-group
        relationships. This is done by a PHP script that ensures no orphaned data remains.</p>
    <h2>App Structure</h2>
    <h3>FrontEnd</h3>
    <h4>Languages used</h4>
    <p>
        In this final state, the web application uses a mix of HTML, SCSS, BEM, and JavaScript to make it as user
        friendly as possible. The app consists of a number of pages including a main feed, a group page, a search page,
        and a book and library page.
    </p>
    <h4>User Interface</h4>
    <p>
        The user interface is simple but friendly and currently contains 13 different pages.
    </p>
    <h3>BackEnd</h3>
    <h4>Languages used</h4>
    <p>For the backend, we have used a mix of PHP and JavaScript.</p>
    <h4>PHP</h4>
    <p>
        Used as our primary programming language, we used PHP in order to connect to the database and get the necessary
        information for every page. Every different action has a different PHP file which is then called by a JavaScript
        file, which fetches the information using AJAX for an asynchronous workaround.
    </p>
    <h4>JavaScript</h4>
    <p>
        JavaScript has been used primarily for AJAX, so we could fetch the
        information from the database. With said information, it dynamically
        showcases the information for pages such as the main page and search, while
        simply adding the information given by the IDs of the divs in pages such
        as the account page and book page.
    </p>
    <h4>Steps of implementation of the project</h4>
