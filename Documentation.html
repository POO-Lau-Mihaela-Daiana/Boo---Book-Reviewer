    <p>
      The purpose of the app is to act like a user friendly book annotation app
      and an online library. With user groups, friends , and a visual news
      section. The user can see when someone leaves a comment on a book, or
      wants to read somethig,etc. The inspiration of this app is the well known
      "Good reads".
    </p>
    <h3>Document Conventions</h3>

      Within the whole web application, we only used a colour pallete of 5
      colours (#3d284f, #57356A , #714E7D, #B790C2, #E3CEDD) and white(#fff).
      For fonts, we used -Nunito Sans

    <h4>Languages used</h4>
    <p>
      In it's current state, the web application uses a mix of HTML, SCSS, BEM
      and JavaScrip to make it as user friendly as possible. The app consists of
      a number of pages including a main feed, a group page, a search page and a
      book and library page.
    </p>
    <h4>User Interface</h4>
    <p>
      The user interface is simple but friendly and currenly contains 13
      diferent pages.
    </p>
    <h3>BackEnd</h3>
    <p>
      Currently, the app is not functional, as we only worked to get the front
      end part done. We plan to use a mix of java scrip and php for the
      functionality down the road
